              <h3>Node Computing Platform</h3>  
              <p>
              The Node Computing Platform solves large systems of diagonally dominant linear equations
              using an implementation of the Gauss-Seidel method on a network of nodes. It can solve
              a matrix consisting of hundreds and even thousands of variables using network based feedback
              to converge onto the solution.
              The web application was implemented using Java, PostgreSQL and frontend web technologies.

              <h3>Sailthru Android SDK</h3>  
              <p>
              The Sailthru Android library collects data on client app usage
              to create a personalized experience tailored for each user.
              The library efficiently stores data and sends it to back-end servers
              for analytics in the background. I also developed an Android application to
              demonstrate and test the functionality of the library.

              <h3>Clapper</h3>  
              <p>
              The Clapper circuit was built for my Intro to Electrical Engineering class. Inspired by the 1980's product, the clapper can switch on and an LED based on a clap sequence. I tuned it to activate the switch on three claps with at least one second betwen them. Most of this project was done with hardware.
