              <h3>Node Computing Platform</h3>  
              <p>
              The Node Computing Platform solves large systems of diagonally dominant linear equations
              using an implementation of the Gauss-Seidel method on a network of nodes. It can solve
              a matrix consisting of hundreds and even thousands of variables using network based feedback
              to converge onto the solution.
              The web application was implemented using Java, PostgreSQL and frontend web technologies.

              Subway Info is a widget for the <a href="http://shopify.github.io/dashing/">Dashing</a> platform.
              This widget displays train arrivals in New York by
              scraping GTFS information from the MTA. It periodically anaylzes it for information
              on arriving trains at subway stops near you.

              <h3>Sailthru Android SDK</h3>  
              <p>
              The Sailthru Android library collects data on client app usage
              to create a personalized experience tailored for each user.
              The library efficiently stores data and sends it to back-end servers
              for analytics in the background. I also developed an Android application to
              demonstrate and test the functionality of the library.

              <h3>Clapper</h3>  
              <p>
              The Clapper circuit was built for my Intro to Electrical Engineering class. Inspired by the 1980's product, the clapper can switch on and an LED based on a clap sequence. I tuned it to activate the switch on three claps with at least one second betwen them. Most of this project was done with hardware. You can see the <a href="https://github.com/parthibanloganathan/Clapper">code and project report</a> on GitHub.
