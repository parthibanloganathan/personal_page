I haven\'t updated this site in a year and I plan to do a complete rehaul using [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) in the near future. But for now, check out my new Android Tutorial that I wrote for ADI [here](https://github.com/parthibanloganathan/android-tutorial). Learn how to build a fully functional Android app to take pictures and tweet in a matter of hours.
