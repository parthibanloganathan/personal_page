My friends and I recently won first place at Facebook Summer of Hack 2013 hosted by Facebook NYC. We made a chrome extension to interactively teach users a foreign language by dynamically replacing words and sentences while they browse the web. It also supports various difficulty levels and text-to-speech in native voices.
