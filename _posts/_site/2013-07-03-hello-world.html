<p>Hello, World! Welcome to my redesigned website and more importantly, my first blog post. While the title of this first post may be as cliche as they come, I hope that the content this blog will soon be populated with isn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>This website was made with ~~blood~~ <a href='http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/'>Bootstrap</a>, sweat and tears. <a href='http://jekyllrb.com/'>Jekyll</a> powers the blog portion of this site and also adds liquid layouts to avoid code repetition. You can check out this website&#8217;s source on <a href='https://github.com/parthibanloganathan/personal_page'>GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>A bit about me at this point in time. I currently work at <a href='https://www.sailthru.com/'>Sailthru</a>, a cool fast-growing startup in New York City as an <a href='http://nycturingfellows.org/the-fellowship/'>NYC Turing Fellow</a>. My primary task is to build their Android SDK. I&#8217;m also working on creating a dashboard to visualize customer analytics. In my first month, I&#8217;ve learned more about Git; dabbled with Ruby and PHP and explored multithreading in Java. Working as a software developer is great, but I imagined that I would be doing a lot more intelligent algorithmic work.</p>

<p>With that I end my first blog post and leave you with these words of wisdom:</p>
