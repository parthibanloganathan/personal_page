Hello, World! Welcome to my redesigned website and more importantly, my first blog post. While the title of this first post may be as cliche as they come, I hope that the content this blog will soon be populated with isn't.

This website was made with ~~blood~~ [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/), sweat and tears. [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) powers the blog portion of this site and also adds liquid layouts to avoid code repetition. You can check out this website's source on [GitHub](https://github.com/parthibanloganathan/personal_page).

A bit about me at this point in time. I currently work at <a href="https://www.sailthru.com/">Sailthru</a>, a cool fast-growing startup in New York City as an <a href="http://nycturingfellows.org/the-fellowship/">NYC Turing Fellow</a>. My primary task is to build their Android SDK. I'm also working on creating a dashboard to visualize customer analytics. In my first month, I've learned more about Git; dabbled with Ruby and PHP and explored multithreading in Java. Working as a software developer is great, but I imagined that I would be doing a lot more intelligent algorithmic work.

With that I end my first blog post and leave you with these words of wisdom:
