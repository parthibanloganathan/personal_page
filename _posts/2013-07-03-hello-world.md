Hello, World! Welcome to my redesigned website and more importantly, my first blog post. This website was made with <del>blood</del> Bootstrap, sweat and tears. Jekyll powers the blog and also adds liquid layouts to avoid code repetition.

A bit about me at this point in time - I currently work at <a href="https://www.sailthru.com/">Sailthru</a>, a cool, fast-growing startup in New York City as an <a href="http://nycturingfellows.org/the-fellowship/">NYC Turing Fellow</a>. My primary task is to build their Android SDK. I'm also working on creating a dashboard to visualize customer analytics. In my first month, I've learned more about Git; dabbled with Ruby and PHP; and explored efficient background processing with threads in Java.

With that, I end my first blog post and leave you with these words of wisdom:
